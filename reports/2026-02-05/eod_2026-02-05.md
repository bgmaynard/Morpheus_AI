## Top Issues to Address

1. **SCANNER_STALE (92.6% of execution blocks)** - MAX_AI scanner data not refreshing; signals pass all gates but blocked at final execution step
2. **insufficient_room_to_profit (59.7% of risk vetoes)** - Spread thresholds may be too tight for small-cap stocks; consider tuning for market reality
3. **regime_position_limit (33.2% of risk vetoes)** - DEAD regime blocking trades; review regime detection sensitivity
4. **Short bias (60.7%)** - gap_fade strategy dominating; mostly fading gappers which were weak today
5. **Zero trade execution** - No live trades means no real P&L data to learn from

## Market Context

- **Regime Summary**: CHOP (primary), some DEAD periods
- **Market Mode**: RTH (Regular Trading Hours)
- **Active Symbols**: 21 monitored

## Event Log Statistics

| Metric | Value |

## Recommended Fixes (Tonight)

| Priority | Issue | Impact | Fix |
|----------|-------|--------|-----|
| 1 | MAX_AI scanner integration | 92.6% blocks | Fix scanner refresh/staleness check |
| 2 | Room-to-profit thresholds | 59.7% vetoes | Tune spread thresholds for small-caps |
| 3 | DEAD regime limits | 33.2% vetoes | Review regime detection or allow 1 position |
| 4 | Worklist purge | Data quality | Fix daily reset logic |

## Notes

- First full day of data collection with Exit Management v1 in place
- System generating signals correctly but blocked at execution
- Scanner staleness is the critical path blocker
- Data collected is valuable for backtesting and threshold tuning
